# Configuration

Lazyfetch is a modular fetch, which means you can easily add new functions and place them on your fetch. <br>
For the sake of speed, lazyfetch is configured directly on the source code, similar to suckless tools. <br>
<br>
Detailed instructions and how to write and configure modules are written on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Jocadbz/lazyfetch/wiki). <br>
(If you don't want to configure those, Lazyfetch is fairly usable on it's default state.) <br>
